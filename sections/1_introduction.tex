The following specification is broken down into two parts. The Predicate wallet written in Sway and the backend JSON-RPC api commands. \\

\textbf{Predicate Wallet:}\

The predicate wallet is a stateless account abstraction wallet written in Sway. The "wallet" contains the logic to validate a
specific transaction types signed by the owner of the wallet. \\

\textbf{Backend:}\

The backend consists of an RPC endpoint that accepts \texttt{eth\_},\texttt{net\_} and \texttt{zap\_} namespace calls and a project
(that is required to build the RPC) called the "zap-executor", which builds and sends transactions to Fuels network, implements the interface
from an API call to the graph-ql port of fuel-core and any translation to evm spec data structures. \\
