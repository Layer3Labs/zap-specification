spec writeup WIP.


% The purpose of \texttt{tx\_type} = 0 is to provide the validation logic for a transaction that initializes the predicate wallet. This consists of calling
% the nonce manager contract which mints "nonce token" assets and sends the mint amount - 1 to the predicate wallet. Once the predicate wallet contains some
% amount of this asset type, and the nonce manager contract contains at least 1 (one) of these assets, the predicate wallet is considered initialized.\\

% The \texttt{tx\_type} = 0 transaction type is necessary to mint "nonce token" assets, without nonce tokens of a specific asset\_id held as a UTXO at the predicate
% wallet address, \texttt{tx\_type} = 1 transactions will not work. Within an EVM Legacy and EIP-1559 transaction the "nonce" field is populated with
% the current transaction count for the account (EOA) making the transaction call. This number (the nonce) is incremented every time a
% transaction is successfully included in a block on an EVM compatible chain. However when constructing a predicate wallet (abstracted account) there is
% no concept built in to a transaction type that includes the facility to obtain a transaction count for a particular address or predicate root. Therefore,
% for a predicate wallet to validate EVM style transactions, that are presented to the predicate as a simple byte stream, there must be a some mechanism by
% which a transaction count (for the predicate wallet) can persist past the scope of a single transaction. Nonce tokens serve the purpose of keeping track
% of the transaction count of a predicate wallet. For each
% successful transaction (EVM style) the nonce token count is reduced by one. That is, for every transaction, the total amount of nonce tokens (held as
% a UTXO) are included as an input to the transaction and the total amount - 1 is included as a transaction output to the same transaction. Thus
% giving the transaction builder an easy mechanism to obtain the current transaction count (nonce) of a predicate wallet.\\
