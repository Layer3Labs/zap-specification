\texttt{\_chainId}\\
Returns the current network/chain ID, used to sign replay-protected transaction introduced in EIP-155.\\

\texttt{\_blockNumber}\\
Returns the latest block number of the blockchain.\\

\texttt{\_getBlockByNumber}\\
Returns information of the block matching the given block number.\\

\texttt{\_getBlockByHash}\\
Returns information of the block matching the given block hash.\\

\texttt{\_getBalance}\\
Returns the balance of given account address in wei.\\

\texttt{\_feeHistory}\\
Returns the collection of historical gas information. \\

\texttt{\_gasPrice}\\
Returns the current gas price on the network in wei.\\

\texttt{\_getCode}\\
Returns the compiled bytecode of a smart contract. \\

\texttt{\_estimateGas}\\
Returns an estimation of gas for a given transaction. \\

\texttt{\_call}\\
Executes a new message call immediately without creating a transaction on the block chain.\\

\texttt{\_getTransactionCount}\\
Returns the number of transactions sent from an address.\\

\texttt{\_sendRawTransaction}\\
Creates new message call transaction for signed transactions.\\

\texttt{\_getTransactionReceipt}\\
Returns the receipt of a transaction by transaction hash. \\

\texttt{\_maxPriorityFeePerGas}\\
Get the priority fee needed to be included in a block.\\

\texttt{\_getTransactionByHash}\\
Returns the information about a transaction from a transaction hash. (note currently will not work for Legacy tx)\\


% --------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{\texttt{zap}}

\texttt{\_getPredicateAddress}\\
returns the address of the predicate wallet on Fuel, for the EVM address.\\

\texttt{\_checkInitialized}\\
returns true or false if the predicate wallet for the EVM address has been initialized.\\

\texttt{\_get\_assetidKey1}\\
Returns the nonce token asset id, for the predicate wallet for key = 1.\\

\texttt{\_get\_initializationTxid}\\
Returns the transaction id of the initialization transaction for the predicate wallet.\\

\texttt{\_submitInitTx}\\
Submits the initialization transaction to the Fuel node.\\

\texttt{\_getTransactionCount}\\

% --------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{\texttt{net}}

\texttt{\_version}\\
Returns the current network id.
